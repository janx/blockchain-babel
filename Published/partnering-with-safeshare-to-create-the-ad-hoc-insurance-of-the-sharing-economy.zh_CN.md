# Partnering with SafeShare to create the Ad-hoc Insurance of the Sharing Economy
# Slock与SafeShare合作为分享经济建立特别保险

The sharing economy presents different challenges to those of the rental sector. Traditional insurance excludes property damages by paying guests and household insurance does not cover damage from third parties, amongst other limitations.

共享经济把不同以往的挑战摆到了租赁行业面前。传统保险和家庭保险有诸多的限制，例如不覆盖付费客人和第三方造成的财产损失。

Slock.it enables anything from lockers to villas to be rented in an ad-hoc, peer to peer fashion. For small items, our build-in deposit system will be often sufficient, but for higher value property, such as vehicles, office spaces or apartments, we have partnered with SafeShare to provide Slock users with a leading insurance product.

Because it supports almost any use case in so many countries, SafeShare is an ideal partner for Slock.it

Slock使得任何事物都可以以对等，点对点的方式出租，无论是储物柜还是别墅。对于小物件，我们内置的保证金系统基本够用，但是对于具有更高价值的物业，例如车辆，办公场所或者公寓，我们通过与SafeShare的合作来为Slock用户提供更好的保险产品。SafeShare是我们的理想伙伴，因为它在非常多的国家都提供了几乎所有用户场景的支持。

With Safeshare, Slock.it smart contracts will be able to offer a revolutionary , universal, on-the-spot insurance where users pay only for the type of insurance they need, when they need it. The insurance provider will read from the Ethereum blockchain when the objects are rented out, and owners will only pay for the time the property was required.

通过SafeShare, Slock智能合约将能提供一种革命性的，通用的，即时保险，用户只需要在需要的时候为他们需要的的保险类型付钱。保险提供商将会从以太坊区块链上得知物品是什么时候出租的，而业主只需要为物业被使用的那段时间支付即可。

The simplicity and elegance of the implementation of the insurance mechanism prototype we are developing with SafeShare would surprise many — it is worlds away from the horribly expensive, slow to implement SOA frameworks from traditional integrators. In many respect, it’s a perfect example of how blockchain technology creates new business opportunities while reducing the cost of operations for the companies that adopt it.

我们正在与SafeShare合作开发一个保险机制原型，相信它的简洁和优美将让许多人感到惊讶 - 传统集成商提供的贵的离谱又难以实施的SOA框架和它完全是两个世界的东西。在许多方面，它都将是区块链技术如何在降低采用企业的运营成本的同时创造新商业机会的完美示例。
